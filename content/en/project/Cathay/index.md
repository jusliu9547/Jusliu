### Objective
Providing the appropriate and accurate credit limit on the basis of risk control according to customer identity information.

### Procedure
1. Searched suitable government open data to fit the given data.
2. Matched the open data categories into anti money laundering categories in order to adjust existing function.
3. Visualized the results through Tableau and utilized the built-in features to emphasize the variables including occupation categories, job title, countries and so on.

By integrating open data into customer identity information, we could provide customer more accurate and appropriate credit limit; on the other hand, using `Tableau` to visualize the final results could reduce the commumication cost.
