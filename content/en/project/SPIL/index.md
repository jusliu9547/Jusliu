### Objective
Developing the fault detection system to earlier identify anomaly and reduce false alarm.

### Procedure
1. Researched on recent studies discussing the related problems about anomaly detection using RNN-based structure.
2. Modified the structure of related works in order to fit our dataset and generate the proper results.
3. Implemented RNN-based time series fault detection model and calculated anomaly score by the difference between predict and actual value.

### Results
Due to close to graduating, I only participated in the proof of concept stage of this project. However, We already implemented the fault detection system locally in `Pytorch` using the relatively small data (with four sensors) to obtain acceptable results.
