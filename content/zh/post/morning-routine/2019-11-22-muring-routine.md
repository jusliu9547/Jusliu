Recently, I am used to work out after waking up and listen Spotify podcast in the meantime, which keep me distracted from the pain and boredom of jogging. Discovering the *The Mindset & Motivation Podcast* is a coincidence because I just finished the latest *Conan O'Brien Need A Friend* podcast and surfing on the featured podcast on App. Whatever, this podcast shows some valuable advices to being productive and living your life without regret.

Let's talk about the title I listened yesterday, namely "*6 Steps to the Perfect Morning Routine*". The acronym for these 6 steps is "**SAVERS**".

1. S: standing for "Slience" or meditation. Usually, the first thing we do after getting up may be picking your phone to scroll the social media or something else. We don't give ourselves time to just get along with ourselves! And meanwhile we often listen that the best ideas always come from driving time or shower time, which just the time whenever you focus and think nothing else. So, taking 10 minutes in the morning will help you absorb your thought and even pop up the best ideas.

2. A: Affirmation. This is just a simple reminder, but helpful. In this 10 mins, all you need to do is reminding yourself what you going to do today, which one skill do you want to improve today, or what kind of person you want to be. To me, I would make a list of what must be done today to keep me productive and stick with my goal.

3. V: Visualization. Thinking about where you might be in next five or ten years, what position you want to have, what relationship want and the most important, what are you going to do to make these reality. Keep thinking these kind of questions will give you the incentive to work hard and focus on the future.

4. E: Exercise. There are tons of studies show the exercise in the moring will make you more produtive and give you enough energy to start a day. While it's not necessary to go to the gym to do bench press, squat or deadlift, exercise could be yoga or easy stretch.

5. R: Reading. To me, the Reading here is not just talking about really read a book, it could be read a novel, news, email (but not working email, you know what I mean). Reading in the morning could let you stay calm and focus, and even more easlier to absorb knowledge.

6. S: Scribing, or journaling. Yeah, you may know why I write this journal now. Writing down simply just what three things you are grateful or you can go more depth to talk about your goal. Whatever it is, the main goal is change the way you run your day, from reactive to proactive. Always know what you going to do!

In the end, here are the [podcast link](https://mwfmotivation.libsyn.com/), wish you like it and it's really helpful to me.
